# Mountain Protocol USD

This smart contract implements a custom rebasing ERC-20 token with additional features like pausing, block/unblock, access control, and upgradability. The contract aims to reflect the T-Bills APY into the token value through a reward multiplier mechanism. Users receive a proportional number of shares when they deposit tokens, and the number of tokens they can withdraw is calculated based on the current reward multiplier. The addRewardMultiplier function is called once a day to adjust the reward multiplier, ensuring accurate reflection of the yield from 3 months maturity T-Bills.

## Dev

This Project uses Hardhat. It includes a contract, its tests, and a script that deploys the contract.

> Prerequisites: Node v18 LTS
